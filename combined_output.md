Our partnership with Meu Labs has significantly enriched our school's technology-focused
education. One of our initial collaborations involved implementing a summer program that
featured an all-in-one STEM curriculum. Meu Labs also developed a customized STEAM
program catering to the specific interests and abilities of our youngest learners, aged 5-8.
• The overwhelmingly positive feedback from both parents and students led us to engage
Meu Labs as educational consultants to design and implement an up-to-date STEAM
curriculum for our official Extra-Curricular Activities (ECA) program. I wholeheartedly
recommend Meu Labs as a reliable educational partner. They are an internationally
accredited institute that adheres to a globally recognized modern curriculum. I am
confident that they can bring the same level of excellence to other educational institutions
seeking to enhance their programs.

"One out of every two
people in the world will
develop a mental
health disorder in their
lifetime".
(Harvard Medical School, *The Lancet Psychiatry*, 2023)


## Slide 3: Elevator Pitch

**(Image: Illustration of a hand holding a brain, symbolizing care and support.  Leaves and abstract shapes form a decorative background.)**

+
**Elevator**
**Pitch**

In a world of fragmented mental health solutions, Happy Mind
stands out as a unified, all-in-one platform, designed to meet
diverse needs with culturally and regionally attuned mental health
support. We're more than an EAP (Employee Assistance Program)
provider or an e-counselling service.

Our 'Oasis' extension, a proactive care measure, provides users
with mood tracking, guided meditations, breathing exercises, CBT-
based reframing tools, focus-building quizzes, and an AI companion
for emotional guidance.

That coupled with our revolutionary e-counselling platform, delivers
tailored mental wellness to individuals and companies, wherever
they are, because true support should be seamless, accessible, and
personalized.

## Slide 4: The Problem - Scale and Ineffectiveness of Current Solutions

**(Image: Illustration of a person interacting with puzzle pieces representing fragmented mental health solutions.  There are also icons representing global impact and economic cost.)**

+
+
**How big is the PROBLEM?**

Mental health disorders affect half
of the world's population.

$
+

Mental health issues cost the global
economy US$ 1 trillion in lost
productivity each year.

?

Available global tele-counselling platforms provide
fragmented and one-size-fits-all solutions,
overlooking cultural nuances, language differences,
and region-specific challenges. This lack of tailored
support leads to user disengagement and poor
therapeutic outcomes.


## Slide 5: Solution - HappyMind

**(Image: Similar illustration to Slide 3, a hand holding a brain, but with a more focused and calming aesthetic.)**

++
**Solution** ❤️

Happy Mind is redefining mental wellness with a unified
platform that offers culturally and regionally attuned mental
health solutions for both individuals and organizations.

Our revolutionary e-counseling platform along with our
powerful 'Oasis' extension equips users with tools to track
moods, access guided meditations, utilize CBT-based
reframing, and engage with an AI 'companion' for real-time
emotional support.

With a focus on personalized care at scale, Happy Mind
empowers individuals and organizations alike, ensuring
proactive support is accessible wherever it's needed.

## File: Copy of Hyperglade Seed 2025.md

Here's a markdown version of the provided text, attempting to preserve the layout and formatting.  I'll also describe the images.


# HYPERGLADE

**rethinking finance**

**(Image 1: A dark blue gradient background with the text "HYPERGLADE" in white, centered. Below it, in a smaller font, is "rethinking finance.")**


## THE PROBLEM

| SUPPLY SIDE | DEMAND SIDE |
|---|---|
| **Businesses** <br> • Limited access to credit. <br> • Most fintech products are expensive. <br> • Traditional options are time consuming, require significant collateral. | **Investors** <br> • Global markets are difficult to access. <br> • Process heavy – requires a large team. <br> • High cost and latency. <br> **DeFi Investors** <br> • Limited access to real world businesses <br> • Low-yield from real world investments. <br> • Lack of transparency in RWA protocols. |

**(Image 2:  A slide with two columns separated by a central header "THE PROBLEM". The left column is labeled "SUPPLY SIDE" and contains a picture of a storefront.  The right column is labeled "DEMAND SIDE" and contains three icons representing investors and DeFi investors.  Bullet points describe the problem from the supply and demand sides.)**


## THE SOLUTION

**(Image 3: A slide with a light purple gradient background. It includes icons representing Bitcoin, a document with a magnifying glass, and an upward-pointing arrow with a box.  Bullet points describe the solutions offered by HyperGlade.)**

* Tokenize revenue-generating real-world businesses for investors.
* Use blockchain to facilitate global transfers cheaper with increased transparency and risk management.
* Efficient and faster disbursement.
* Increased access to credit.


## THE OPPORTUNITY

**(Image 4:  A slide with a light purple gradient background. It features icons depicting a world map, a document, and a dollar sign.  Bullet points describe the opportunity presented by the solution.)**

* Global trade financing gap is currently widening beyond $2.5 Trillion
* There's opportunity for blockchain-backed payment systems to connect businesses with global credit markets.
* Blockchain offers a smart contract-based asset system to connect global credit markets.
* Stable coins and Private Credit are two markets uniquely positioned to innovation.


## TECHNOLOGY

**SMART ASSETS**

Smart Assets are digital assets embedded with smart contracts and enriched with risk data.

**(Image 5: A diagram illustrating a "Traditional Approach" versus what appears to be HyperGlade's proposed approach (implied).  The diagram shows a traditional banking system with multiple layers (Core Banking Layer and Settlement Layer) and processes involved in a loan application.  It contrasts this with the concept of "Smart Assets" – suggesting a more streamlined and efficient process. )**

**Traditional Approach**

*Diagram depicts a flowchart showing the various steps and systems involved in a traditional loan application process including Core Banking Layer, Compliance Checking Systems, Document Management Systems, Internal Approval Interfaces, and 3rd Party App (credit scoring + Risk assessment).*

# Hyperglade's Smart Asset Based Approach

**(Slide 1)**

A diagram is shown with the title "Hyperglade's Smart Asset Based Approach".  The diagram depicts a system with three main layers:

* **Smart Asset Layer:** Contains "Smart Contract", "Smart Contracts Engine", "Automated Logic", "Risk Analytics", and "Price Discovery".
* **Settlement Layer:**  A lower layer indicating the final stage of the process.
* **Data Oracle:** Connects the Smart Asset Layer to various data sources.

Data flows from:

* **Borrower (Retailer's invoices):** Input data from the borrower.
* **Data Feeds (e.g., Bloomberg):** External data sources.
* **Retailer Data:** Data specific to retailers.
* **CPG Data:** Data from consumer packaged goods companies.

These data sources feed into "Market Insights" and then to the "Smart Asset Layer".

A text box at the bottom right provides a list of "Data Sources and Indicators", including financial ratios and qualitative metrics.


**(Slide 2)**

A table compares the "Status Quo (FIs)" with "Hyperglade" across various aspects of trade finance:

| Action        | Status Quo (FIs)                                                                                                                                         | Hyperglade                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Onboarding** | i. Borrowers need to initiate and go through a time-consuming process. <br> ii. Longer application processing time. <br> iii. High operational cost due to human intervention in KYC and application process. | Pre-approved list of borrowers from partner brands. <br> Thousands of borrowers are instantly onboarded with a single partnership. <br> KYC data is collected via partner brands, streamlining the borrower signup process. |
| **Cost**       | Traditional payment rails that are expensive and prices out smaller transactions. <br> Cross-border payments require multiple systems to work in tandem, which often delays the reconciliation while being expensive. | Use of stable coins reduces transaction costs allowing smaller and more frequent transactions to take place. <br> Optimized using stablecoins for transactions, reducing friction and cost. |
| **Price Discovery** | Price is set using standard systems that are not curated for the dynamic changes of trade financing.                                                               | Dynamic with oracle and transparent. Can be individually dynamic. Narrowed and singled out.                                                    |
| **Risk Assessment** | Requires extensive relationship with the borrower, good credit history of owners and/or collateral. <br> Each decision point may require new data pulls. <br> Rich data exists but often siloed across systems.          | Utilize borrowers' operational performance for risk assessment. <br> Automated cascading of decisions. <br> Each transaction enriches the risk model in real time. |
| **Operation**   | Teams of analysts, financial executives and accountants are required to onboard, analyze, disburse, and collect.                                                   | Self-executing logic based on data state changes allowing for continuous disbursement and collection once the system is in place.            |


**(Slide 3)**

This slide presents a market analysis of the trade finance gap, showing concentric circles representing the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).  The figures are as follows:

* **TAM (Global Trade Finance Gap):** $2.5 Trillion
* **SAM (APAC):** 600 Billion
* **SOM (SG, ID, TH, VN, PH, NZ):** 2 Billion


**(Slide 4)**

This slide contains two charts and a graph.

* **Graph:** Shows the increase in the Global Trade Finance Gap from 2015 to 2022 (in trillions of dollars and as a percentage of global exports).
* **Bar Chart 1:** Presents significant supply chain issues faced by firms, highlighting high transportation costs as the most significant issue (34%).
* **Bar Chart 2:** Illustrates reasons for rejection of trade finance applications, with insufficient collateral or guarantee being the most frequent reason (42%).  Another chart shows reasons for the increase in supply of trade finance and supply chain finance over the next 2 years.


**(Slide 5)**

This slide depicts Hyperglade's "Go-to-Market" strategy, showcasing partnerships with CPG partners (e.g., P&G, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Unilever), lenders, and payment providers (e.g., Mastercard, CBA).  The diagram illustrates how Hyperglade acts as a platform connecting these stakeholders, facilitating the onboarding of borrowers (retailers) and managing risk.  A visual representation of the relationships between CPG partners, lenders, payment providers and Hyperglade platform is shown.


Here's a markdown transcription of the provided document, including descriptions of the images:

This slide shows a graph illustrating the potential yield versus the actual yield of coconut trees over their lifespan.  The graph highlights a significant difference, indicating that palm plantations only reach about a third of their potential yield.  Two numbered sections explain short-term (pests) and long-term (nutrients, hydration, pests, diseases) factors contributing to this low yield.
